### _echoCMS examples_

These examples are intended as code examples to show how PHP statements are used in HTML to get data from the CMS, then echo it on to the page, and (particularly) how the `this`, `prev`, `next` and `tab` links work.

### Setup
The examples are really intended just as code examples but if you do wish to install them on your server:
* Complete setup as per cms/README.MD
* Import the tables from cms/examples/setup/setupDatabase.sql into your database
* Replace the cms/content directory with cms/examples/setup/content

>Note: by default the cms directory and the examples directory are expected to be at the top level of the root directory, if you have installed either in a sub-directory then see the **Installation** section in the main README for details of what to change.
